# Quiz

## Summary
An interactive quiz made with Blazor WebAssembly.

## Detail
This is a very basic quiz made up of four questions themed around halloween.
I've wanted to learn Blazor for a while so this was something I could do on my own with a very limited scope.
I've kept the spookiness at an all time low.
