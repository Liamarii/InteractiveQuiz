# InteractiveQuiz

## Summary
An interactive quiz made with Blazor WebAssembly.

## Detail
This is a very basic app made which lets you pick between 3 different quiz themes, answer questions and get a result.

I've wanted to learn Blazor for a while so this was something I could do on my own with a very limited scope.
